Max heigth of  an AVL Tree = c*log2(n+2) + b
c = 1.4405
b = -1.3277

Properties of Red Black Tree:-
1) Every node has a color either red or black.
2) The root of tree is always black.
3) There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).
4) Every path from a node (including root) to any of its descendant NULL node has the same number of black nodes

As a result:  Number of nodes on the path from a node to its farthest descendant should not be more than twice the number of nodes on 
              the path to its closest descendant.
